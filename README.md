# 👁️ Diabetic Retinopathy Detection (Deep Learning + Grad-CAM)

A Streamlit-based web application that detects diabetic retinopathy (DR) stages from retinal fundus images using deep learning models.  
The app supports **automatic model download**, **Grad-CAM visualization**, and **PDF report generation** for clinical use.

---

# 📌 Overview

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness among diabetic patients.  
Early detection is essential, and deep learning models can help clinicians analyze retinal fundus images quickly and accurately.

This project provides:

✔ Automatic DR Stage Classification  
✔ Grad-CAM heatmaps for model explainability  
✔ Multi-image batch processing  
✔ PDF reports for patients  
✔ Streamlit UI for easy usage  
✔ Models automatically downloaded from Google Drive  

---

# ⭐ Features

- ✔ Upload multiple retina images  
- ✔ Automatically download trained DL models from Google Drive  
- ✔ Predict DR severity: **Healthy → Severe DR**  
- ✔ Grad-CAM heatmaps for medical interpretability  
- ✔ Generate PDF reports with patient details  
- ✔ Clean, responsive UI built using Streamlit

# 🔥 Why Grad-CAM?
Grad-CAM provides visual explanations for CNN predictions by highlighting regions in the image that influenced the model's decision. In medical AI systems like diabetic retinopathy detection, interpretability is critical because clinicians must verify whether the model is focusing on pathological regions rather than irrelevant features.

---

# 🖼 Grad-CAM Visualization
For each image, the app:

1. Predicts DR class

2. Generates Grad-CAM heatmap

3. Displays original + heatmap side-by-side

4. Includes the heatmap in the final PDF report

---

# 📄 PDF Report Generation
The PDF includes:

- Patient name, age, gender
- Notes (optional)
- Prediction table
- Confidence scores
- Side-by-side image + Grad-CAM
- Doctor signature field

Fully downloadable with 1 click.
